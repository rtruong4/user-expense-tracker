# Takehome Project LeanData

This project is a frontend project which logs a list of users, their expenses, and the total cost of their expenses combined. It was implemented with React js using hooks.

## Steps to run project

- Download files to computer and extract folder
- Open folder and navigate to user-expenses directory
- Run 'npm install' then 'npm run start' through command line

## Design tradeoffs

- UI/UX is extremely barebones trading off for functionality
- Certain searching methods could possible be faster, but I was unable to implement them due to time constraints
